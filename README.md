## Projects
#### Blocasa - Decentralised Rental App

 - Co-developed the front-end of a decentralised rental app as part of the Polkadot x Astar Network x EasyA Blockchain Hackathon. Our team secured 3rd place and a prize of $1,000. Technologies used: React, HTML, CSS, ChatGPT.

#### Kinematic Reconstruction using Forward-Tagging at The Large Hadron Collider (Group Project)

- Adapted and tested kinematic reconstruction code using C++
- Co-authored the report in LaTeX/Overleaf (Grade: 79%)

#### A Convolutional Neural Network Neutrino Event Classifier

- Developed classifiers and a regression model for neutrino images, achieving an F1 score of 0.81. The project was implemented in Python using Keras, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Numpy. Grade: 91%

#### Measuring the Cosmic Ray Muon Lifetime

- Performed data analysis and curve-fitting of muon detector measurements using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn). Grade: 79%

#### StartupGPT

- Developed a GPT-wrapper that generates a start-up idea, 1-minute pitch, MVP ideas, market-sizing and product roadmap over a weekend. Used langchain, streamlit, OpenAI api among others.
